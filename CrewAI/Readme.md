# 🚀 CrewAI

**CrewAI** is a lean, lightning-fast Python framework for organizing AI agents into specialized, collaborative teams that solve complex tasks—just like real-world companies with departments like Sales, Engineering, and Marketing working together toward a common goal.

> 🧠 Inspired by human organizations. Powered by autonomous AI.

## 🌟 Features

- **👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Crew Mode** – Create teams of agents with specialized roles.
- **🌊 Flow Mode** – Execute streamlined, single-function LLM tasks.
- **🧩 Modular Design** – Seamlessly build workflows from reusable components.
- **🤖 Autonomous Agents** – Agents have roles, tools, and decision-making power.
- **📈 Efficient Task Flow** – Collaborate across agents with purpose-driven processes.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Crew** orchestrates operations and manages teams.  
2. **AI Agents** perform specific roles (e.g., researcher, writer).  
3. **Process** defines the task order and team collaboration dynamics.  
4. **Tasks** are objective-based units of work completed by agents.

## ⚡ Installation

Install via pip:

```
pip install crewai
```

## 🚦 Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get your first crew running:

```
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process

# Step 1 – Define AI Agents
researcher = Agent(
    role='Researcher',
    tools=['web'],
    capabilities=['data gathering']
)

writer = Agent(
    role='Writer',
    tools=['LLM'],
    capabilities=['content generation']
)

# Step 2 – Define Workflow
workflow = Process(
    steps=['research', 'writing'],
    strategy='sequential'
)

# Step 3 – Build the Crew
blog_team = Crew(
    name='Blog Content Team',
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    process=workflow
)

# Step 4 – Assign a Goal
blog_team.execute(goal='Write a blog post about AI in healthcare')
```
